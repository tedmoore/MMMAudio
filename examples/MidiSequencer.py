"""
A sequenced polyphonic synthesizer controlled via a MIDI keyboard.

This example demonstrates a couple differnt concepts:
- How to Pseq and Pxrand from mmm_python.Patterns to create sequences of notes and other parameters.
- How to create a coroutine to schedule note triggers using the MMMAudio scheduler.
