"""This example demonstrates the Buchla 259-style wavefolder distortion on a sine wave.

The Buchla Wavefolder is a classic wave-shaping synthesis technique that adds harmonic complexity to audio signals by folding the waveform back on itself when it exceeds certain thresholds. This results in a rich, complex sound often used in electronic music synthesis. Derived from "Virual Analog Buchla 259e Wavefolder" by Esqueda, etc.

Use the BuchlaWaveFolder_AD version for Anti-comptimeing (ADAA) and Oversampling. The ADAA technique is based on Jatin Chowdhury's chow_dsp waveshapers.

It is recommended to plot the output waveform to get a sense of how the wavefolding process alters the sound."""
