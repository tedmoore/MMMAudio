"""
Shows how to load and audio buffer from a sound file and play it using the Play UGen. 

This example uses open sound control to control Play's playback speed and VAMoogFilter's cutoff frequency. These can be sent from a simple touchosc patch or any other OSC controller. A touchosc patch is provided for control.

This example is able to run by pressing the "play" button in VSCode or compiling and running the whole file on the command line.
