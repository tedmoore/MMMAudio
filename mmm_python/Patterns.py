"""
Pattern classes for generating sequences of values.

This module provides pattern classes inspired by SuperCollider's pattern system
for generating sequences, random selections, and non-repeating random selections
from lists of values.

Classes:
    Pseq: Sequential pattern that cycles through a list
    Prand: Random pattern that selects randomly from a list  
    Pxrand: Exclusive random pattern that avoids immediate repetition
