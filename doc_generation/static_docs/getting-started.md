# Getting Started with MMMAudio

[Mojo's Python interop](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/python/) is still getting smoothed out so things will likely change.

Here is what works now. The instructions are aimed at and have been tested on MacOS (currently Mojo's compiler is MacOS & Linux only).

## 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/spluta/MMMAudio.git
```

## 2. Setup the Environment

`cd` into the root of the downloaded repository, set up your virtual environment, and install required libraries. this should work with python 3.12 and 3.13.  If you find it does or doesn't work with other versions [let us know](https://github.com/spluta/MMMAudio/issues).

depending on your system set up, you may need to explicitly specify the Python version here, eg: 'python3.13 -m venv venv'

```shell
python -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate

pip install numpy scipy librosa pyautogui torch mido python-osc python-rtmidi matplotlib PySide6
```

install modular's max/mojo library
the main branch is tied to Mojo 0.25.6.1

```shell
pip install mojo==0.25.6.1
```

### 2a. Setup the Environment on MacOS

Use your package manager to install `portaudio` and `hidapi` as system-wide c libraries. On MacOS this is:

```shell
brew install portaudio
brew install hidapi
```

MMMAudio uses `pyAudio` (`portaudio`) for audio input/output and `hid` for HID control.

Then install `pyaduio` and `hid` in your virtual environment with your `venv` activated:

```shell
pip install hid pyaudio
```

if you have trouble installing/running `pyaudio`, try this:
1. [do this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68251169/unable-to-install-pyaudio-on-m1-mac-portaudio-already-installed/68296168#68296168)
2. Then this uninstall and reinstall `pyaudio` (`hidapi` may be the same).

### 2b. Setup the Environment on Windows/WSL2 with Ubuntu

Here are some hints to get the audio samples running under Windows/WSL2. 
I used the Unbuntu distro, but if you adapt the package manager, it will also work on other distributions.

Use your package manager to install `portaudio` and `hidapi` as system-wide c libraries. On MacOS this is:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libportaudio2 portaudio19-dev
sudo apt install libhidapi-hidraw0 libhidapi-dev
sudo apt install pulseaudio
```

Use your package manager to install `ALSA runtime` and `ASLA utilities` as system-wide c libraries. On Ubuntu this is:

```shell
sudo apt install alsa-utils
sudo apt install libasound2-dev
```

Verify the installation. You should see a version number

```shell
aplay --version
pkg-config --modversion alsa
```

To make the Windows audio devices "visible" inside WSL2, please install and configure PulseAudio bridge as follows:

Use youe packagemanger to install `PulseAudio`. On Ubuntu this is:
```shell
sudo apt install pulseaudio alsa-utils
```

Create a sound config rc file in your user home directory with the follwing content:
~/.asoundrc
```shell
pcm.!default {
    type pulse
}
ctl.!default {
    type pulse
}
```

Start pulseaudio and verify that the WSLg PulseAudio server is reachable:
```shell
pulseaudio --start
ls -l /mnt/wslg/PulseServer
```

Check also that PortAudio detects PulseAudio
```shell
pactl info
```

Now run your MMMAudio script WITHOUT running pulseaudio --start and enjoy the sound:
```shell
python3 examples/DefaultGraph.py
```

## 3. Run an Example

The best way to run MMMAudio is in REPL mode in your editor. 

to set up the python REPL correctly in VSCode: with the entire directory loaded into a workspace, go to View->Command Palette->Select Python Interpreter. Make sure to select the version of python that is in your venv directory, not the system-wide version. Then it should just work. 

Before you run the code in a new REPL, make sure to close all terminal instances in the current workspace. This will ensure that a fresh REPL environment is created.

Go to the [Examples](examples/index.md) page to run an example!
