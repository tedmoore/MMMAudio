# Contributing to MMMAudio

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MMMAudio! This guide will help you get started.

## Code

Due to Mojo's Pythonic nature, contributing to the development of the MMMAudio's DSP framework is very approachable. 
Please do find and raise issues. If there are issues in the repo that you want to tackle, please get in touch!

## Documentation
